# N0H4TS Community Meetup – Bug Bounty Basics

**Date:** August 2025  
**Speaker:** Anne-Laure Ehresmann (YesWeHack)  
**Event:** N0H4TS Community Meetup  

## Overview  
This was an introductory workshop on **Bug Bounty Basics**, delivered by Anne-Laure Ehresmann from YesWeHack. The session provided insights into how bug bounty hunting works in real-world applications, highlighting the differences between CTF-style vulnerabilities and live program testing.  

## Key Learnings  
- **Hunter’s Mindset** → Approaching applications with business context in mind, not just running tools.  
- **Effective Reporting** → Writing structured bug reports that demonstrate real **impact**, not just technical findings.  
- **End-to-End Workflow** → Understanding a professional hunter’s process: reconnaissance → vulnerability discovery → reporting.  

## Takeaways  
- CTF challenges (XSS, injections) are useful practice, but **real-world bug bounty** requires a broader, impact-driven mindset.  
- Reporting quality is as important as vulnerability discovery.  
- Gained new perspectives on how bug bounty hunters align technical findings with business value.  

## Acknowledgments  
Grateful to the **N0H4TS Community** for organizing and to **YesWeHack** for sharing industry expertise.
