**Date:** August 2025  
**Event/Organizer:** Div0  
**Category:** Reverse Engineering

## 📝 Overview  
A hands-on workshop focused on reverse engineering **without relying on traditional assembly tools**. The session walked through analyzing binaries using logic, problem-solving, and creative approaches instead of disassemblers or debuggers.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques  
**Tools Used**  
- Basic system utilities (strings, hexdump, file)  
- Python for scripting  

**Techniques Practiced**  
- Binary analysis without IDA/Ghidra  
- Understanding program logic from raw output  
- Applying problem-solving workflows under constraints  

---

## 🔑 Key Learnings  
- Reverse engineering is possible without heavy tooling — focus on **process and logic**.  
- Practiced thinking like an attacker while working with limited resources.  
- Gained confidence in analyzing binaries through fundamental methods.

## 🎯 Takeaways  
This workshop reinforced the importance of a **mindset-driven approach** to reverse engineering. Even without advanced tools, systematic problem-solving can reveal program behavior and vulnerabilities.

## 📂 Notes  
I followed along with the workshop but did not produce a personal write-up.
